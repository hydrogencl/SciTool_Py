# Scientific Tool Assemble

## SCI_TOOL

This will be the main contribution to the scientific programming tools, including:

### progress bar ###
Based on the work from stackflow, the progress bar can be used in `Jupyter` and `Terminal` and Python IDE. 

## Taylor's Diagram - YS

This is a simple example of Taylor's diagram, which requires only `matplotlib`. 
Please note that the spacing between 0.9 to 0.99 is the same as other numbers. 

## Gridtrans

This is used to create and read the output/input files for these format:

- `.pfb`
- `.csv`
- `.sa`
- `.dat`  (seperater is `,`)
- `.xyz`

With `matplotlib` user can use it to quickly plot the array files. 

## Bib_Corrected

A small tool to fix the .bib file, to remove all the round bracket that can not be read by `Gummi`. 
Before running the bibliothek function of Gummi, run this script to let `Gummi` read the .bib file.
